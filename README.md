# Week One Challenge- Refactoring Horiseon App

## Description

  In this challenge we are asked to take the existing code, which is repetitive and needlessly formatted, and consolidate and clean it up, but to keep the original look of the website. 

## Process

  To complete this task, I first went through the html file and noted which areas needed improvement. The website used a ton of div elements, as well as some unnecessary class tags, and, again, unneeded formatting. After that I examined the CSS style sheet and also noticed a lot of bloat, and strange nonessential coding, as well as a lot of disorganization.

  After notating which changes I'd make, and how that would affect the page, I went into the browser and made sure that the changes I imagined in my head would correlate properly. I was able to go back into both files and slowly changed and reformatted items. This included moving items in the CSS code up or down depending on where it lay on the page. 

##Result

  While I am not 100% happy with my end result, as I think there may be some things I'm unfamiliar with, I believe I reduced the amount of code needed for the website to run. I made a couple small stylistic changes that are most likely fine (such as turning a light grey to white). My newer version has proper semantic formatting of the HTML and is easier to navigate, and the CSS formatting is condensed and in a more logical order.
